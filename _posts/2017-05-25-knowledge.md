I want to start by quoting Bertrand Russell. For those who don't know, Bertrand
Russell is dead. He used to be a mathematician---but that was many years
ago---and the reason I bring him up is, in some ways, irrelevant to this fact.
He is important not because I knew him personally and he affected me
specifically in some way, but rather because in his writings he seems to attempt
making intertwined the various ideologies of human thought which he concerns
himself with. A title of one of his essays, for example, is _Mysticism and
Logic_, which are two things ordinarily unrelated. It is that in the essay, he
attempts to bring together the two theories. I believe this to be a general
human faculty, some kind of method which brings previous ideas together in
important, new, useful ways.

In examining this sort of unionization of ideas, one probably asks about the
reasonable platforms which the ideas might be constructed upon. Perhaps one
could argue that it is through the English language that one constructs ideas.
This would seem reasonable by the way that I am communicating ideas in the
moment now. I make references to things, then use the points made by the things
referenced to not only inform about the old ideologies referred to by the
references, but pursue making of them something meaningful and relevant to the
present (or at least meaningful and relevant to me).

How I see it, Bertrand Russell presents everything by a kind of logical proof.
He asserts relations between objects in ordinary existence. He determines the
truth or falsehood of the statements in relations to themselves. Then attempts
determination of all of the possible outcomes given the assumptions. These
assertions, however, require something to make it all plausible. He often times
makes his arguments through ordinary English, but he could also present the
ideas in other languages that he is well aware of---like French and German,
which are two other languages belonging to him---however it was at the beginning
that I called him mathematician, and so it is rather with the particular
platform of mathematics that I believe he authors the native beliefs of his
sentence constructions.

It is my belief that mathematics represents that without ambiguity. I have come
to find that more natural languages cannot represent exactly what mathematics
does, even though these languages are eventually the things which share the
details of the mathematics. In _Mysticism and Logic_ Russell claims there is a
"mystic insight" which "begins with a sense of mystery unveiled." I believe this
to be a sort of abstract mathematics that makes up everything that humans wish
to share in detail. He continues later to say:

> The first and most direct outcome of the moment of illumination [mystic
> insight] is belief in the possibility of a way of knowledge which may be
> called revelation or insight or intuition, as contrasted with sense, reason,
> and analysis, which are regarded as blind guides leading to the morass of
> illusion.

> Why are numbers beautiful? It's like asking why is Beethoven's Ninth Symphony
> beautiful. If you don't see why, someone can't tell you. I know numbers are
> beautiful. If they aren't beautiful, nothing is ---Paul ErdÅ‘s

> of words with whose meanings we are acquainted.... All thinking has to start
