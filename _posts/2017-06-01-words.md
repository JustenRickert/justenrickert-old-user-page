So I have a tendency to think a lot about language. I'm not sure why. In
learning programming languages I've always tended to relate their syntax to the
English that I know, and thought usually that the most well-written code is the
kind which reads most closely to natural language
([something Richard Davey, thinks as well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZxzuHY97ug),
though making this relation contradicts somewhat the typical definition of
code). I can quote my roommates as telling me that they "don't want to have
semantic arguments" with me, though truthfully I only wished to denote better
the thoughts they were having.

Recently I had a conversation with a friend and I brought up the word
"ubiquity." It's not the most common word to say and she seemed a little
confused by it. I'm sure she had acquaintance with the word, at least, and could
have picked out the meaning of it, though I told her that it means about the
same thing as the word _commonplace_, which is pretty close. Google's definition
of the word is this:

__u·biq·ui·ty__ /yo͞oˈbikwədē/ _noun_ 

> The fact of appearing everywhere or of being very common.

She then asked me why I didn't just use the word "commonplace" instead. I made
the remark that this replacement word for ubiquity is in fact actually two
separate words conjoined together! Who would want to use a silly conjunction in
place of an established word that has the same definition. This is probably not
a good argument, though there are so many different contexts that it all really
depends anyways, right? I think if some really good point ends in utilizing a
word as unique and precise as the word ubiquity, then it must be better to end
with that, something concise and functional, instead of some hideous
amalgamation of two common words placed together. In any case, here's what I
think of the word. (Beforehand I must admit that I'm a little inspired
by
[this blog](http://www.grammarphobia.com/blog/2015/07/ubiquitousness-ubiquity.html).)
