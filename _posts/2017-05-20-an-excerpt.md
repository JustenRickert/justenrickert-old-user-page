## From Writing

> "A man rose one day from a large rock he was sitting upon to look down at the
> ground under his feet. He spat in the grass to his side, then picked up a
> small rock close to where he was sitting and brought it close to his face. He
> imagined a possibility of something inside of the rock in his hand as he
> stared at it, which caused human emotion to suddenly stretch across his face.
> The rock rose in his arms as he stretched them into the air above his head,
> then he began to throw the rock downwards with great force upon the larger
> one. When the rocks collided, debris from the collision scattered across the
> ground all around. The noise from the impact quickly subsided.

> "Shards of smaller rock sat freshly partitioned into slivers. The man took one
> of the larger slivers into his hand and uttered something under his breath,
> followed by amazement according his countenance. He squeezed the rock with
> enough force to then find a fresh cut dripping blood from his palm, as the
> rock happened to have become sharp at the spot where chips of itself had
> broken off. His knees bent so his hands could reach the ground. His hands
> grasped some dry dirt, which then dressed his wound. His mouth spoke again

There are laws to argument. There exist laws in the fabric of the universe that
people are always meant to be trying to figure out. The syntax of conversation
encoded the laws somehow. As a blur at first, but then through repetition they
become clearer. It is through this decision to reiterate through them, to
practice the scenarios in our heads, to rearrange the possibilities of what
could have happened that makes what we think important. It is by a sort of
argument that we understand better the laws of argument; circularly we argue the
laws which turn around our thoughts and causes us to improve the laws we
initially set our gaze upon to argue. Perhaps that is the purpose of existence;
to figure out this argument; to see the laws in the fabric of our daily lives
and to decide that there needs to be something common in our group understanding
of the event, then needing that there is a denotation according to some fashion
which reestablishes the laws in a way better suited to making apparent the
initial individual comprehension of the law, where the primordial law
established what it meant to argue.

To the original man, it was an inspiration of some kind. He found that the force
of his proceedings, his hand striking together rocks, caused the rocks to break.
It was a conversation through argument. Firstly, the rock argued it could not be
broken, where the man saw that his strength was great and so begged to differ.
Then the rock argued it could not be useful; it could not be sharp. As the man
cuts his hand on the newly found sharp edge of the rock, it becomes clear to him
that the apparent law established by the rock was only meant to make the man
repudiate his actions. In this state, the existence of the sharp utensil
purportedly only confirms the possibility of hurting the man who endeavored to
dispute the original meaning of the rock's existence; just as the man endeavored
previously, he will continue; as such the argument will go on according with the
man's own dissatisfaction with the universe.

I believe
this
[arguing to be a sort of mathematics]({% post_url 2017-05-23-mystical-mathematical-argument %}) that
we are always trying to better. It is something that should have been perfect as
the viewport in front of us, that when found to be imperfect lead us to try to
correct it. That is because this sort of mathematics should have been correct
and verifiable (such is this definition of mathematics). It is the contradiction
that says mathematics, which should always consist of true statements, leads one
to consider that the opposite of one of the statements was actually false. This
is however useful, as were it not for the contradiction then the laws of
mathematics would be inconsistent in that they would not contain the
contradiction, but were it not for the contradiction nobody would attempt to
argue better the laws of argument. And so it goes.
