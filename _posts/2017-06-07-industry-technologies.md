I've recently been searching the job market high and low, and finding how
important it will be to market myself well. Resumes are things compact with
keywords and descriptions, and surely there is a most effective way to arrange
them.

My searching has also changed my ordinary day. Previously my interests filled my
schedule, whereas now it is the interests of the commercial world that do.
Before starting to read daily about WordPress, Drupal, and other content
management systems, I read about programming languages used for data
manipulation. Alas now I change my ways such that more people might come to know
me some day. I propose two words necessary for fulfilling this task: _buzzword_
and _advertise_.

The Current Task
----------------

First I give the definition of the terms. This will ensure that anybody will
have the opportunity to be on the same page.

> <span class="ipa">__buzz·word__ / ˈbəzˌwərd/ _noun_</span>

> > a word or phrase, often an item of jargon, that is fashionable at a
> particular time or in a particular context.

> <span class="ipa">__ad·ver·tise__ / ˈadvərˌtīz/ _verb_</span>

> > describe or draw attention to (a product, service, or event) in a public
> medium in order to promote sales or attendance.

Given these definitions it should be clear that effective usage of the words
will satisfy the problem I am having. I must make the people of this particular
context have a fashionable opinion of me. If relevant future employers feel that
I am up-to-date on the current technologies and ideas, then they will be more
apt to hire me. It is the usage of appropriate _buzzwords_ which gives them such
an opinion of me only if I can manage to _advertise_ myself effectively. I will
attempt to grok such a vocabulary having these words and formulate a way to show
myself off such that all of my qualities relevant to them are on display.

The Future
----------

> <span class="ipa">__no·o·sphere__ / ˈnōəˌsfir/ _noun_</span>

> > a postulated sphere or stage of evolutionary development dominated by
> consciousness, the mind, and interpersonal relationships.

> ... the individual human being represents a corpuscular magnitude [so] he must
> be subject to the same development as every other species of corpuscles in the
> World: that means that he must coalesce into physical relationships and
> groupings that belong to a higher order than his. --- Pierre Teilhard de
> Chardin, __Heart of Matter__

> "At that node of ultimate synthesis, the internal spark of consciousness that
> evolution has slowly banked into a roaring fire will finally consume the
> universe itself. Our ancient itch to flee this woeful orb will finally be
> satisfied as the immense expanse of cosmic matter collapses like some
> mathematician's hypercube into absolute spirit." --- Pierre Teilhard de
