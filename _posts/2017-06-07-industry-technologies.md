I've recently been searching the job market high and low, and finding how it
important it will be to market myself well. Companies probably receive more
resumes than what is actually possible to read, so must either discard them with
brief glances, or order them by the number of keywords found relevant to their
day to day workflow to allow choosing from the small subset accumulating at top
of the pile. (Though I may actually might be wrong about this, as it seems the
types of companies I get the most responses from actually have the least to do
with the information on my resume.)

I also feel that my needing to search has put some strain on my ordinary day.
Previously my own interests filled up my schedule, whereas now it seems the
interests of the commercial world do. Before starting to read daily about
WordPress, Drupal, and other content management systems, I read about
programming languages used for data manipulation. Alas now I change my ways such
that more people might come to see me some day. I propose two words necessary
for fulfilling this task: _buzzword_ and _advertise_.

The Current Task
----------------

First I give the definition of the terms. This will ensure that anybody will
have the opportunity to be on the same page.

> <span class="ipa">__buzz·word__ / ˈbəzˌwərd/ _noun_</span>

> > a word or phrase, often an item of jargon, that is fashionable at a
> particular time or in a particular context.

> <span class="ipa">__ad·ver·tise__ / ˈadvərˌtīz/ _verb_</span>

> > describe or draw attention to (a product, service, or event) in a public
> medium in order to promote sales or attendance.

Given these definitions it should be clear that the words satisfy the problem I
am having. I must make the people of this particular context have a fashionable
opinion of me. If relevant future employers feel that I am up-to-date on the
current technologies and ideas, then they will be more apt to hire me. It is the
usage of appropriate buzzwords which gives them such an opinion of me given that
I can manage to advertise myself effectively; so I should attempt to grok such a
vocabulary and formulate a way to show myself off such that all of my relevant
qualities are on display.

The Future
----------

> <span class="ipa">__no·o·sphere__ / ˈnōəˌsfir/ _noun_</span>

> > a postulated sphere or stage of evolutionary development dominated by
> consciousness, the mind, and interpersonal relationships.

> ... the individual human being represents a corpuscular magnitude [so] he must
> be subject to the same development as every other species of corpuscles in the
> World: that means that he must coalesce into physical relationships and
> groupings that belong to a higher order than his. --- Pierre Teilhard de
> Chardin, __Heart of Matter__

"At that node of ultimate synthesis, the internal spark of consciousness that evolution has slowly banked into a roaring fire will finally consume the universe itself. Our ancient itch to flee this woeful orb will finally be satisfied as the immense expanse of cosmic matter collapses like some mathematician's hypercube into absolute spirit." --- Pierre Teilhard de Chardin
