    <p> If you're curious about how I made this blog, check out <a
        href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/">Jonathan McGlone's
        guide</a>.

        It also might be useful to check out <a
        href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/">jekyll's documentation</a>, or <a
        href="https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/">this
        other post about setting up github pages</a>.

        The source code for the blog is also available <a
        href="https://github.com/JustenRickert/justenrickert.github.io">on my
        github</a> so you can get an idea of him how I set things up to work. </p>

    <p> If you're curious about me, you should read my blog. I recently
        graduated from the University of Minnesota (Twin Cities) with an
        undergraduate degree in Mathematics, and currently seek a social
        community to be actively engaged with. </p>
